# Agent ACP Kit Integration

Use this reference whenever a workspace app owns local Agent execution.

## Rule

Depend on a released exact version of `@tutti-os/agent-acp-kit`. The kit owns provider plugins, detection, canonical provider aliases, managed header handling, ACP lifecycle/event parsing, permission responses, MCP normalization, Tutti CLI execution, timeout/cancellation, and schema validation.

The app owns product orchestration, its backend endpoint, prompt policy, app tools, persistence, and UI. It must not patch kit build output or copy platform protocol code.

Daemon-owned Agent Session apps are a different execution model: they may use Tutti CLI start/get/cancel commands and must not instantiate an app-owned local runtime merely for consistency.

## Runtime shape

```text
App use case
  -> app Agent service
    -> @tutti-os/agent-acp-kit/tutti catalog/composer/skill facade
    -> app-owned @tutti-os/agent-acp-kit runtime execution
      -> run-scoped app MCP/tool gateway
```

Create the full default runtime once:

```ts
import { createDefaultLocalAgentRuntime } from "@tutti-os/agent-acp-kit";

export const localAgentRuntime = createDefaultLocalAgentRuntime();
```

Provider IDs are canonical opaque strings. The runtime lists `claude-code`; it accepts legacy `claude` input internally. Apps must not add provider conversion helpers or register compatibility providers.

Read `references/dynamic-agent-providers.md` for catalog, composer, persistence, UI, and standalone behavior.

## Platform context

The `@tutti-os/agent-acp-kit/tutti` subpath exposes three auto-detecting server-side functions:

```ts
import {
  loadTuttiAgentComposerOptions,
  loadTuttiAgentProviderCatalog,
  loadTuttiAgentSkillContext
} from "@tutti-os/agent-acp-kit/tutti";
```

Do not pass a mode. When `TUTTI_CLI` is absent, catalog/composer use standalone runtime discovery and skill context is empty with `source: "standalone"`. When `TUTTI_CLI` exists, the kit uses it. A configured CLI failure is a typed error and never silently falls back.

The app does not use daemon URL, server credential, workspace identity, or app identity for Agent catalog/composer queries. Those values may still be required for unrelated app-scoped resources.

## Runtime execution

For each run:

1. Generate a stable run ID and use the canonical provider ID returned by the facade.
2. Await `createManagedAgentRunContextFromHeaders(...)` directly. It reads and validates the managed credential, canonicalizes supported legacy input internally, creates a safe managed cwd, and rejects unsupported managed providers. The app must not pre-read the credential or perform a separate provider-support precheck.
3. When no managed header exists, use an app-owned local cwd.
4. Load Tutti skill context when platform skills are useful, passing browser/computer capability flags from trusted app policy.
5. Create a run-scoped MCP/tool gateway and prompt envelope.
6. Call the local runtime with the same canonical provider ID.
7. Adapt events to the app stream and persist only session/resume metadata.
8. Revoke gateway tokens and clean app-owned temporary files in `finally`.

Skeleton:

```ts
import {
  createDefaultLocalAgentRuntime,
  createManagedAgentRunContextFromHeaders
} from "@tutti-os/agent-acp-kit";
import { loadTuttiAgentSkillContext } from "@tutti-os/agent-acp-kit/tutti";

const localAgentRuntime = createDefaultLocalAgentRuntime();

const runContext = await createManagedAgentRunContextFromHeaders(req.headers, {
  providerId,
  runId
});
const cwd = runContext?.cwd ?? appLocalRunCwd;

const tuttiContext = await loadTuttiAgentSkillContext({
  provider: providerId,
  agentSessionId: runId,
  cwd,
  browserUse: appPolicyAllowsBrowser,
  computerUse: appPolicyAllowsComputer,
  signal
});

const systemPrompt = [
  appSystemPrompt,
  tuttiContext.recommendedSystemPrompt?.content
].filter(Boolean).join("\n\n");

for await (const event of localAgentRuntime.run({
  runId,
  provider: providerId,
  runtimeProvider: providerId,
  runtimeKind: "local-agent",
  cwd,
  prompt,
  systemPrompt,
  model,
  reasoning,
  mcpServers,
  resume,
  signal,
  skillManifest: [...appSkills, ...tuttiContext.skillManifest],
  timeoutMs,
  managedAgentInvocation: runContext?.managedAgentInvocation
})) {
  yield adaptLocalAgentEvent(event);
}
```

`recommendedSystemPrompt` is advisory content. The app decides whether and where to merge it. Do not append it invisibly in a generic transport layer.

Derive `appLocalRunCwd` from trusted server-side app policy. Never accept a browser-provided cwd for a managed run. Never put a credential or managed cwd in request bodies, browser state, DTOs, logs, persistence, or error text.

## Event mapping

Normalize at least:

- text deltas and final assistant text;
- thinking/reasoning text;
- tool calls and tool results;
- status/progress and usage;
- file writes;
- stderr/log events;
- completed, canceled, and failed terminal events;
- provider session ID or resume token.

General ACP lifecycle, Cursor update parsing, permission result shape, config-option/model fallback, prompt content blocks, and MCP env conversion belong in the kit. An app may retain only explicit product-specific presentation or orchestration adapters.

## Tool gateway

Expose app abilities through a run-scoped gateway:

- mint one token per run;
- pass it only to the MCP server process or command bridge;
- validate token, run/session identity, tool name, and schema on every call;
- revoke it when the run completes, fails, or is canceled;
- keep tools app-level: read app context, inspect state, mutate app artifacts, start app jobs, persist outputs, or read app-owned files.

MCP config pattern:

```ts
import type { LocalAgentMcpServerConfig } from "@tutti-os/agent-acp-kit";

export function createAppToolsMcpServerConfig(input: {
  gatewayBaseUrl: string;
  gatewayToken: string;
  packagedMcpPath: string;
}): LocalAgentMcpServerConfig {
  return {
    name: "app-tools",
    type: "stdio",
    command: process.execPath,
    args: [input.packagedMcpPath],
    env: {
      APP_TOOL_GATEWAY_URL: input.gatewayBaseUrl,
      APP_TOOL_TOKEN: input.gatewayToken
    }
  };
}
```

Package builders must bundle the MCP entrypoint. Production MCP configs must not depend on bare `pnpm`, system `node`, source-tree TypeScript paths, or runtime dependency installation.

## Verification

Add tests for:

- auto CLI-backed and standalone catalog/composer/skill behavior without a mode input;
- configured-but-failing CLI returning a typed error without standalone fallback;
- full dynamic provider projection and lazy composer loading;
- canonical IDs and one-time `claude -> claude-code` state migration;
- direct awaited managed run context creation, with no app credential precheck;
- no managed secret/cwd leakage;
- event normalization, cancellation, and resume metadata;
- MCP env/path packaging and gateway token revocation;
- absence of raw Agent catalog clients, provider alias helpers, and dependency patch scripts.

For a real smoke test inside Tutti, load the catalog, one provider's composer options, and skill context before running a narrow cancellable prompt with no irreversible side effects.
